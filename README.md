# Description 

If you are like me your the type of person that needs to watch someone do it then do it yourself and double-check or sometime you may learn how to do it and then just go completely blank after learning it anyway  
 So for my base was fairly simple thanks to Mr.Helmstetter putting in videos of how to create the bases on all of the parts but I also went back to fundamentals just to remember short cuts on sketching I found myself going back and looking at measurements in the video a lot so I decided to take my notebook and write down the measurements so I didn’t have to go back and rewatch the video to hear the measurements all the time base is just a rectangle so and some holes.

 Reflections  
You’re not gonna get everything right the first time it’s ok to start over but also you can ask Mr.helmsetter for help when you’re creating make sure you click the right lines also don’t stress out that you have 6 circles there’s supposed to be 6 his videos cut off the 6th circle don’t assume what to do double-check.


(#Mount)

# Description 
 
 round two the mount this was somewhat difficult because at first, I did it directly on top of the base which is where it’s supposed to be but some of you may ake separate document for your parts I kept it in one and then turned off the other parts so it was like a new document but I could see if I had put it in the right place,

#refelction 
I did have trouble with making a  a dimension between my midpoint and left side  and ended up restarting so I had moved one and ignored it  but that didn’t help so I talked to Mr.helmstetter during office hours to ask for help and hi showing e how to fix it so on shape could solve it though I don’t remember exactly what he said to me It did help and I was able to continue so he had me go into my sketches of the mount and switch the lines I coincident and taught me how to take screenshots with ut taking a picture of everything on the screen 



(#Fork)

# Description 

Fork sport, as usual, I wrote down the dimensions so I didn’t have to keep switch between tabs  For my for I had to pay close attention to how I placed my dimensions making sure I didn’t click something off while making my fork I put it on the wrong face and had to start over to put it on the other side creating mirrors was fairly simple and explained well enough in the video so I didn't have trouble.

To behonest I didn't really have trouble with my parts the video to me explaiend it well enough I jjust need to pay close attention to what I was clicking I'm sorry but i just need to get my head straight and get things done on time and as for help if i needed it. 


(#Tire)

# Description 

As for my tire, I am a perfection is so I wanted to look the exact same as in the video but I had to let that go with making it because it’s not supposed to look like the perfect I shape making dimensions, as usual, is somewhat troubling but as usual that always my fault for not paying attention to what I’m clicking that’s why there’s a reverse button to click.

 #  Reflections  
For my tire, wheel, and axel, and collar I made a sperate part studio which is at the bottom plus sign next to you part studio 1 you’ll see create a part studio and rename it to keep it separate the one thing about the tire was creating inner and out dimensions and making sure that my dimensions was below the construction line and doubled  


(#Wheel)
# Description 
The wheel rolling but not really so the wheel an I mine didn’t exactly snap so it did frustrate me but it’s fine because I fixed it in the end, as usual, creating circles make sure you make construction lines and that they are correct they help a lot you are going to constrain this sketch you are revolving this sketch make sure you do. You’re going to make construction lines directly from the origin and make something like a pie and going to cut out a window on your wheel a copy it for ore tie on your wheel.

I’m sorry I am horrible at writing journals you can see by now I feel like I was like blackout while making my parts cause I don’t even really remember what I did, but, trying I deeply apologize for whoever reads this it probably won’t help, but I need the grade. 


(#AxleCollarBearings)

Alright, final parts I do usually turn on my parts after finishing just to make sure they are where there supposed to be and look similar before continuing I just went through a lot with making this part I can’t even remember what I did except following everything the video told me which I say a lot and begging horrible at dimensions but this should come easy because you basically already made it with all your other parts just by its self now.

#refelction 

I really need to pay attention to what I did because I can’t explain it and that’s all I got really just know that you can also zoom window if you need to see closer to parts also zoo ti fix will zoo you out not in if you’re on your chrome book when taking a screenshot press ctrl shift and your multiple window button and make a box on what you want to screenshot also rename your file for each part so your not submitting the wrong things. 

I am sorry
